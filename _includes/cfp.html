                <div class="cfp">
                    The 1st Workshop on Bridging AI and Data-centric SystemS (BADASS) workshop aims to address these critical and timely challenges by bringing together scientists, engineers, cognitive scientists, practitioners, data enthusiasts, and students in an interdisciplinary forum where they can share experiences and ideas, discuss the results of their research on models, methodologies and algorithms, and forge new collaborations that will lead to the development of new applications and tools to transform information extracted from data into actionable intelligence.

                    BADASS will be held in conjunction with ADBIS 2024 conference in Bayonne, France.
                    It is planned to be an in person workshop with virtual elements (if possible a direct stream of presentations will be organized). 
                    
                    BADASS invites submissions of original research, practical experiences, evaluation results, or novel approaches and applications related to artificial intelligence and data management.
